			<h1>Nadia Botha Resume</h1>

			<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
				<p>I am creative analytical thinker who is passionate about problem solving and technology. </p>
				<p>I have a BEng Mechanical Engineering degree as well as 5 years of postgraduate experience in the consulting and manufacturing industries. Despite learning a great deal in this profession, I have decided to pursue my passion for coding, problem solving and to develop new technologies, with a primary focus on back-end development.</p>

				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<h3>Python - Finance Calculator</h3>
				<h5>HyperionDev &nbsp JUN 2020</h5>
				<p>The program enables a user to run an investment or a home loan repayment calculator.</p>
				<p>The investment calculator takes the type of interest, interest rate, amount of deposit and the number
					of years to invest as input and returns the value of the investment in the specified years. The home
					loan repayment calculator takes the value of the house, the interest rate and number of months to
					replay the bond as input and returns the monthly bond payment. The program is useful to banks
					and other financial service providers to quickly calculate return on investments or monthly bond
					repayments.</p>
				<p>Methods used: Control structures<br>
					<a href = "https://github.com/NadiaBotha/Task10_Lvl01-Capstone01"> See GitHub repository</a></p>
		
				<h3>Python - Task Management Tool</h3>
				<h5>HyperionDev &nbsp JUL 2020</h5>
				<p>The program is a task management system that enables a user to perform functions based on
				their login rights.</p>
				<p>The program is login protected, meaning that the user has to be registered with a username and 
					password. A non-admin user can add tasks and assign other users to it, view all tasks and view all 
					tasks allocated to them. The admin user can do all of the above and also register new users, 
					generate reports and statistics, which displays the number of tasks completed, still to be 
					completed and overdue. It also displays the work load per user. The program is useful for teams 
					that need to track multiple tasks that are completed by different people.</p>
				<p>Methods used: Control structures, user defined functions, arrays, dictionaries, read and write text
				files.<br>
				<a href = "https://github.com/NadiaBotha/Task10_Lvl01-LastCapstone"> See GitHub reporsitor</a></p>
		
				<h3>Java & SQL - Project Management Tool</h3>
				<h5>HyperionDev &nbsp JAN 2021</h5>
				<p>It is a project management system used by a structural engineering firm used to create and 
				edit projects, employees and customers. All data is stored within a database.</p>
				<p>The user can create new projects, architects, contractors and customers, which is written to a 
					database. The user can also access this information at a later stage to edit, filter or simply view it 
					directly from the database. The projects can also be finalized, which generated an invoice if there  
					is an outstanding amount payable to the project. The program is ideally suited for a structural 
					engineering or construction firm.</p>
				<p>Methods used: Object-orientated programming, JDBC, SQL, control structures <br>
				<a href = "https://github.com/NadiaBotha/Task08_Lvl03_Capstone-1">See GitHub repository</a></p>

				<h3>Python - Machine Learning using Linear Regression</h3>
				<h5>HyperionDev &nbsp JAN 2021</h5>
				<p>The program loads the dataset 'diabetes' from the sklearn package, after which the data set is divided into a training set and a testing set. The training data is used to 
					calculate the best fit line gradient and y-intercept. After detemining the linear function it is plotted on a figure along with the testing data scatter plot to use for comparison.
				</p>
				<p>Methods used: Numpy arrays and creating plots with matplotlib.pyplot.<br>
				<a href = "https://github.com/NadiaBotha/Task21_Lvl03-Machine_Learning03"> See GitHub reporsitory</a></p>

				<h3>Python - Machine Learning using K-Means</h3>
				<h5>HyperionDev &nbsp JAN 2021</h5>
				<p>The program opens external csv files which lists countries with their birth rates and life expectancies. It then groups countries into clusters with similar birth rates and 
					life expectancies, by using the k-means method. The output is a scatter plot with all the clusters in different colors for each iteration. The number of clusters and iterations is defined
					by the user.</p>
				<p>Methods used: Numpy arrays, plots with matplotlib.pyplot, control structures, user defined functions, lists, reading csv files <br>
				<a href = "https://github.com/NadiaBotha/T22_Lvl03-Machine_Learning04">See GitHub repository</a></p>

				<h3>Python - Machine Learning using Polynomial Functions</h3>
				<h5>HyperionDev &nbsp JAN 2021</h5>
				<p>The program takes a data in matrix form and generates three functions, a linear best fit, a quadratic best fit and a cubic test fit. All three functions are then plotted on the same
					figure along with the scatter plot of the test data, in order to compare accuracy.</p>
				<p>Methods used: Numpy arrays and creating plots with matplotlib.pyplot.<br>
				<a href = "https://github.com/NadiaBotha/T23_Lvl03-Machine_Learning-Capstone"> See GitHub reporsitory</a></p>
